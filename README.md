# Swapper
Swapper automatically changes a token’s artwork based on which direction it is facing. As a token rotates, the module swaps its image to the closest matching image variant using a rotation‑to‑suffix table. This allows creators to use directional sprites, multi‑angle character art, or custom pose sets that visually respond to movement and turning.

The module supports both global settings (shared by all tokens) and per‑token overrides, giving you full control over how each creature behaves. A built‑in editor lets you define rotation angles and file suffixes through an intuitive table interface, and tokens can optionally use their own local table for unique behaviors.

 

With a simple naming convention and a few configuration clicks, your tokens become more dynamic, expressive, and immersive as they turn on the battlefield.

The only restriction is that you image file names must end in some sort of suffix that denotes their facing, like character_North, character_South, character_East and character_West, etc.
